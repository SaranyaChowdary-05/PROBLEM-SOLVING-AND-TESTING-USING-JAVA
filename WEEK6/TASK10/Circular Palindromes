QUESTION:
A palindrome is a string that reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.

Given a string, , of  lowercase English letters, we define a -length rotation as cutting the first  characters from the beginning of  and appending them to the end of . For each , there are  possible -length rotations (where ). See the Explanation section for examples.

Given  and , find all  -length rotations of ; for each rotated string, , print the maximum possible length of any palindromic substring of  on a new line.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer,  (the length of ).
The second line contains a single string, .

Constraints

Output Format

There should be  lines of output, where each line  contains an integer denoting the maximum length of any palindromic substring of rotation .

Explanation

Consider Sample Case 1, where .

The possible rotations, , for string  are:
.






The longest palindromic substrings for each  are:
 and , so we print their length () on a new line.
, so we print its length () on a new line.
 and , so we print their length () on a new line.
 and , so we print their length () on a new line.
 and , so we print their length () on a new line.
 and , so we print their length () on a new line.
 and , so we print their length () on a new line.



ANSWER:
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    // Function to find longest palindromic substring length
    public static int longestPalindrome(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int maxLen = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            // Odd length palindrome
            int left = i, right = i;
            while (left >= 0 && right < n && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
                left--;
                right++;
            }

            // Even length palindrome
            left = i;
            right = i + 1;
            while (left >= 0 && right < n && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
                left--;
                right++;
            }
        }

        return maxLen;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = sc.nextInt();
        String s = sc.next();

        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            // Create rotation
            String rotated = s.substring(k) + s.substring(0, k);

            // Print longest palindrome length for this rotation
            System.out.println(longestPalindrome(rotated));
        }

        sc.close();
    }
}
