QUESTION:
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces. 

ANSWER:
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int maxLength = 0;
        int left = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            char currentChar = s.charAt(right);

            // If character already exists, move left pointer
            if (map.containsKey(currentChar)) {
                left = Math.max(left, map.get(currentChar) + 1);
            }

            // Update the latest index of the character
            map.put(currentChar, right);

            // Calculate max length
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
}
